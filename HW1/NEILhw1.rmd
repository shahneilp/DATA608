## Neil Shah HW1: DATA 608

**Principles of Data Visualization and Introduction to ggplot2**

I have provided you with data about the 5,000 fastest growing companies in the US, as compiled by Inc. magazine. lets read this in:

```{r}

inc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleyferrari/CUNY_DATA_608/master/module1/Data/inc5000_data.csv", header= TRUE)

```

And lets preview this data:

```

```

Think a bit on what these summaries mean. Use the space below to add some more relevant non-visual exploratory information you think helps you understand this data:

***
These summaries provide robust statistics on the overall columns in the data-set. They give us a cursory view of the entire data-set and alert us to overall trends, outliers and serve as a baseline to start out analysis. 

As a financial profession--I really like to look at skewness to give me an idea of how a distriubtion might lean.

I found this package called Performance Analytics [here](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/12/13/introduction-to-skewness/) and used it's skew function.

Let's apply this to the numerical categories in inc.

```
library('PerformanceAnalytics')

> skewness(inc$Growth_Rate)
[1] 12.55327
> 
> skewness(inc$Revenue)
[1] 22.1811
> skewness(inc$Employees)
[1] 29.81938

```

Notice that all of these values have a positive skew--meaning that they have tails to the right--this is interesting and might point to possible outliers. From a robust statistics side--we might need to look at median instead of mean to get an idea of variability. 




*** 


## Question 1

Create a graph that shows the distribution of companies in the dataset by State (ie how many are in each state). There are a lot of States, so consider which axis you should use. This visualization is ultimately going to be consumed on a 'portrait' oriented screen (ie taller than wide), which should further guide your layout choices.


#Answer Question 1 here

First lets get some imports

```
library(ggplot2)
library(zeallot)
```

Now let's make a table and group by State

```

state <- inc %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(Count = n())

```
Take a look at it

```
head(state)

> head(state)
# A tibble: 6 x 2
  State Count
  <fct> <int>
1 AK        2
2 AL       51
3 AR        9
4 AZ      100
5 CA      701
6 CO      134

```

Ok let's sort this out

```
> state %>% arrange(desc(Count))
# A tibble: 52 x 2
   State Count
   <fct> <int>
 1 CA      701
 2 TX      387
 3 NY      311
 4 VA      283
 5 FL      282
 6 IL      273
 7 GA      212
 8 OH      186
 9 MA      182
10 PA      164


state <- state %>% arrange(desc(Count))

```


Now let's plot it

```
>ggplot(state, aes(x = reorder(State, Count), y = Count)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity") +ggtitle('Number of Companies by State Sorted')

```

![Number of Companies by State Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1plot.png)


Alright--now let's clean it up, add some color and fix the axis so we can see the labels.

```
ggplot(state, aes(x = reorder(State, Count), y = Count)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill='blue') +ggtitle('Number of Companies by State Sorted')+coord_flip()

```

![Number of Companies by State Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1plot2.png)

Since I just learned about date-ink ratio--let's try to apply it here.
I am referencing the methods from [Felix Fans Reference Site](https://felixfan.github.io/ggplot2-remove-grid-background-margin/)


```
> ggplot(state, aes(x = reorder(State, Count), y = Count)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill='grey') +ggtitle('Number of Companies by State Sorted')+coord_flip() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
+ panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))

```

![Number of Companies by State Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1plot3.png)


There--much cleaner! So it seems that the top states are CA, TX and then NY. 

Let's zoom in on the top values to focus onthem

```
> ggplot(head(state), aes(x = reorder(State, Count), y = Count)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill='grey') +ggtitle('Number of Companies by State Sorted')+coord_flip() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
+ panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))
> 

```


![Top by State Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1plot4.png)

This makes some sense to me given that these states have the highest populations. 


*** 


## Quesiton 2

Lets dig in on the state with the 3rd most companies in the data set. Imagine you work for the state and are interested in how many people are employed by companies in different industries. Create a plot that shows the average and/or median employment by industry for companies in this state (only use cases with full data, use R's `complete.cases()` function.) In addition to this, your graph should show how variable the ranges are, and you should deal with outliers.


So based on our data-set we are looking at good ole NY

First let's sort out our dataset for NY only and by industry

```

> inc %>% filter(State=='NY') %>%filter(complete.cases(.)) %>% group_by(Industry)
# A tibble: 311 x 8
# Groups:   Industry [25]
    Rank Name                      Growth_Rate  Revenue Industry                     Employees City      State

# ... with 301 more rows```

```

I like to do a quick summary statistics to explore the data-set

```
> summary(inc %>% filter(State=='NY') %>%filter(complete.cases(.)) %>% group_by(Industry))
      Rank                        Name      Growth_Rate        Revenue                                  Industry

   Employees              City         State

                   (Other)  :112   (Other):  0  

```

Two things that I want to point out--1) State only has values for NY, which is good! That means my filter by NY worked out and 2) looking at the statistical summary of Employees--the max is 32000 which is well above the IQR ranges; we definitely are going to have outliers!




The easiest way to display variance, median and spread is a boxplot; let's do that. 
To make things easier I'll save the modified dataframe.

```
ny <- inc %>% filter(State=='NY') %>%filter(complete.cases(.)) %>% group_by(Industry)
ggplot(ny,aes(x=Industry,y=Employees))+geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()

```

![Box Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1boxplot.png)


Looks like we have some serious outliers!

So I could extract the outliers and remove them but what is easier is just to cut my axis and hide the outliers.

```
> ggplot(ny,aes(x=Industry,y=Employees))+geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA)+ ggtitle('NY Industry Employee Boxplot') + coord_flip()+ylim(0,1000)

```

![Box Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1boxplot2.png)

Now let's combine everything like we did before and make the plot readable via our Data to Ink ratio method. 

```

> ggplot(ny,aes(x=Industry,y=Employees))+geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA)+ ggtitle('NY Industry Employee Boxplot') + coord_flip()+ylim(0,1000) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
+ panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))

```

![Clean Box Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1boxplotclean.png)

Much nicer!

I'm going to include one more zoomed in plot just to see more granuarity. 

![Clean Box Plot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\HW1boxplotclean2.png)

So looking over the data just some quick observations: <br>
The Travel and Hospitality indstry has the largest spread/variability, given the whisker range/IQR range. <br>
Computer hardware and Government Services have the most narrow spreads <br>
The median for the NY industries are all below 250 <br>
Government services has the lowest median employees. <br>
Environmental Services ahs the highest median employees. <br>


Fascinating--ths would be a cool study to dig down further.

## Question 3

Now imagine you work for an investor and want to see which industries generate the most revenue per employee. Create a chart that makes this information clear. Once again, the distribution per industry should be shown.


First let's define a metric called medianemp defined by Revenue/Employees. 
``` 
subset(inc, complete.cases(inc)) %>%
    mutate(medianemp = Revenue/Employees)
    
```

I am going to just store this as a new dataframe to make my life easier

```

inc_investor <- subset(inc, complete.cases(inc)) %>%
    mutate(medianemp = Revenue/Employees)

```

Let's quickly look at summary statistics

```
> summary(inc_case)
      Rank                          Name       Growth_Rate         Revenue

                (Other)               :4983                                        
                         Industry      Employees                  City          State        medianemp       
 IT Services                 : 732   Min.   :    1.0   New York     : 160   CA     : 700   Min.   :    1801  
 Business Products & Services: 480   1st Qu.:   25.0   Chicago      :  90   TX     : 386   1st Qu.:  125000  
 Advertising & Marketing     : 471   Median :   53.0   Austin       :  88   NY     : 311   Median :  198658  
 Health                      : 354   Mean   :  232.7   Houston      :  76   VA     : 283   Mean   :  393613  
 Software                    : 341   3rd Qu.:  132.0   San Francisco:  74   FL     : 282   3rd Qu.:  375000  
 Financial Services          : 260   Max.   :66803.0   Atlanta      :  73   IL     : 272   Max.   :40740000  
 (Other)                     :2351                     (Other)      :4428   (Other):2755   
 
 ```
 
 Focusing in on medianemp--the metric i defined, it appears that the median is around $200,000 per employee and most of the distribution is under $400,000--however look at that outlier! Let's investigate. 


Let's plot this out 

```

> ggplot(inc_investor, aes(factor(x = reorder(Industry, medianemp, FUN = median)))) +
+ stat_summary_bin(aes(y = medianemp), fun.y = "median", geom = "bar") +
+ coord_flip()

```

![Median Revenue/Employee by Industry](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\caseplot1.png)

Now combining our plotting methods from before

```

> ggplot(inc_investor, aes(factor(x = reorder(Industry, medianemp, FUN = median)))) +
+ stat_summary_bin(aes(y = medianemp), fun.y = "median", geom = "bar") + coord_flip() + xlab("Industry") + ylab("Median Revenue/Employee")+ ggtitle('Median Revenue by Employee for Industry across the US') + theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
+ panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))

```
![Median Revenue/Employee by Industry](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS-Data Science\DATA 608\caseplot2.png)


Much cleaner and clearer! 

If we recall from the origianl summary table--the median revenue per employee was around $200,000 but it seems that two industries are out liers (on the high end)--Computer Hardware and Logistics and Transport. As an investor--I don't want average performance since we have to beat the market; Computer Hardware and Logistics Transports seem two industries we should further analyze for invesment opportunities. 

This provies a good starting ground for an investment thesis!

## Conlusions

In this assignment I was able to load a dataframe, maniuplate it through filtering, produce summary statistics and plot the data in a clear/easy to read fashion. 

These skills--while basic--are powerful and will serve as the foundation for my Data Analysis.
